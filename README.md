# Daily Python Practice
These are my .py       coding daily         practices that I have made. Most of it are for loop practices.

**note: that most of these code are not the most efficient way to solve the problem. However, it is a good method to practice the basic logic*

```python  
    while(True):
        :shipit:
```
